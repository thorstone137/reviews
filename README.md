# Reviews

Reviews is a child theme of Simone built as a demo of how to add custom post type and taxonomy data to a theme. There are several branches to this theme, each of which shows a different level of integration. The Master branch is the simplest application.

Reviews requires a custom post type plugin with a post type named "review" and taxonomies named "genre", "rating", "feature", "mood", and "release_year".
